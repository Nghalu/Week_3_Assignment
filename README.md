# Discount Calculator 

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
It only applies the discount if the discount percentage is **20% or higher**.
## How It Works
1. The program asks the user for:
   - The original price of the item
   - The discount percentage
2. If the discount percentage is **20% or more**, the program applies the discount.
3. Otherwise, the original price is kept without changes.
4. The program handles invalid input (non-numeric value.)
